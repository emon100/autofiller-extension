      "question": "Is my data safe with 1Fillr?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Your data is stored locally on your device and never transmitted to our servers. We use industry-standard encryption for any sensitive information. You have full control over your data and can delete it at any time."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "Which job sites does 1Fillr support?",
      "answer": "1Fillr works with all major Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) including Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, Ashby, BambooHR, iCIMS, and hundreds more. It also works on custom job application forms."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "How does the learning work?",
      "answer": "When you fill out a job application form, 1Fillr observes which answers you provide for different types of questions. It learns the semantic relationship between questions and answers, so it can recognise similar questions on other sites even if they're worded differently."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "What if 1Fillr fills something incorrectly?",
      "answer": "Every filled field shows a visual badge. You can hover over any field to see what was filled and click to undo. 1Fillr also won't auto-fill sensitive fields (like salary expectations) without your explicit confirmation."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "Do I need to create an account?",
      "answer": "No account is required to use the free tier. Your data stays entirely on your device. An account is only needed if you want cloud sync or purchase additional credits."
    },
    "q6": {
      "question": "Can I get a refund?",
